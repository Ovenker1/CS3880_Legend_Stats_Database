How to set up and deploy our database

1. Download both files (.sql and .py)

2. In Pythonapp.py at line 8 change the password to whatever your password is

3. Configure the .sql script with your database. (We used mySQL workbench).

4. Then open a terminal, we used windows powershell. 

5. Use the command python pythonapp.py

6. Then you will have acess to the database if the passwords match. 

7. You can freely use the LoL Database Tool to track stats and compare.
